# Prosperos-Island

This repository encapsulates what you get when a CS major takes an English class and needs to make a final project.

Prospero's Island is a game with similar mechanics to The Impossible Game. The characters and rationale behind the game is inspired by Shakespeare's play "The Tempest."

For anyone curious about the metaphorical framework: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IpKJ_OJML7ZRiHpdyuAH9H-woSD-U5lQs5MjgpM4KPo/edit?usp=sharing
